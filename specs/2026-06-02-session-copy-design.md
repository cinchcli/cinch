# `cinch session copy` — Design Spec

Date: 2026-06-02
Status: Approved (brainstorm) → implementation
Scope: cinch monorepo (`crates/cli` + `crates/client-core`). No relay change.
Test platform: macOS only (first cut).

## Problem

When working in an agent coding session (Claude Code today; codex / gemini-cli
later), the user sometimes wants to grab a **specific answer** out of that
session and carry it elsewhere — paste it into another AI/agent for a second
opinion or continuation, move it to another machine, or keep it for later
search/reference.

Plain `Cmd-C` is poor for this: the session lives as a noisy JSONL transcript
(`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl`) mixing user/assistant text
with tool calls, tool results, thinking blocks, and base64 attachments. You
cannot cleanly select "that one answer" by hand, and the raw text is unusable.

cinch is positioned to add real value over plain copy because the captured
content lands in cinch's clip pipeline: it **syncs across devices**, becomes
**searchable (FTS)**, and is **immediately on the system clipboard** for paste.

## Goal

A user-triggered command that lets you:

1. **Select a session** (default: the most recent session of the current
   working directory's project; or by id prefix; or via an interactive picker).
2. **Select which answer(s)** within that session to copy (interactive picker /
   `--last [N]` / `--all`).
3. Render the selection to **clean Markdown** and **both** save it as a cinch
   clip and place it on the system clipboard.

Non-goals (this cut): the AI-distilled "handoff packet" (Phase 2), codex /
gemini-cli source readers (structure for it, don't build it), Windows/Linux
testing (cross-platform code is fine; only macOS is validated now), a fancy
full-screen TUI (a numbered-list + stdin selection is the picker MVP).

## Definitions

- **Answer (unit of selection):** one full assistant response to a single user
  prompt — i.e. everything from a real user prompt up to (but not including) the
  next real user prompt. This spans possibly multiple assistant records with
  interleaved tool-use / tool-result steps, ending at the assistant's final
  text. This is the unit the user selects and copies. (Confirmed with user.)
- **Session:** one `*.jsonl` transcript file.
- **Source:** the agent tool that produced the session. `claude` now;
  `codex` / `gemini` are future trait implementations.

## Command surface

```
cinch session copy [SESSION] [--from claude]

  SESSION              session id prefix | "latest" (default) | (with --pick) interactive
  --from <source>      session source. default & only value now: "claude"
  --pick               interactively choose the SESSION too (not just the answer)

  # answer selection (mutually exclusive; default = interactive answer picker):
  --last [N]           last N answers (default N=1). non-interactive → slash-command default
  --all                whole session (every answer, in order)

  # options:
  --with-prompt        include the eliciting user prompt above each answer
  --include-thinking   include assistant thinking blocks (default: off — noise for handoff)
  --no-tools           exclude tool calls/results (default: include, results truncated)
  --stdout             write Markdown to stdout instead of saving a clip
  --no-copy            skip the system-clipboard copy
  -l, --label <text>   clip label (default: derived session/answer title)
```

`--from` defaults to `claude`. Bare `cinch session copy` ⇒ source=claude,
session=latest-in-cwd, answer=interactive picker.

### Selection model (two levels)

1. **Session resolution.** Map `cwd` → Claude's encoded project dir name
   (replace `/` with `-`, leading `-`), i.e.
   `~/.claude/projects/-Users-...-relay-main/`. Pick the most recently modified
   `*.jsonl` by default. `--pick` shows a session list (title + mtime +
   id-prefix); a positional `SESSION` matches an id prefix.
2. **Answer resolution.** Parse the chosen session into an ordered list of
   answers. Default: interactive picker (numbered list with a one-line preview
   per answer; user types one or more numbers / a range). `--last [N]` and
   `--all` are the non-interactive paths. Slash command uses `--last`.

Interactive picker requires a TTY; if stdin is not a TTY and no
`--last`/`--all` was given, error with a clear message pointing at `--last`.

## Architecture

### `client_core::session` (new, reusable — desktop can consume later)

A small module, source-agnostic:

- `model.rs` — plain data types:
  - `Session { id, title: Option<String>, path, answers: Vec<Answer> }`
  - `Answer { index, prompt: Option<Prompt>, parts: Vec<AnswerPart> }`
  - `AnswerPart` enum: `Text(String)`, `ToolUse { name, input }`,
    `ToolResult { truncated_text }`, `Thinking(String)`,
    `Attachment { label }`
- `source.rs` — `trait SessionSource` with:
  - `list_sessions(cwd) -> Vec<SessionRef>` (id, title, mtime)
  - `load(session_ref_or_latest) -> Session`
  - `ClaudeSource` is the first impl. It owns the cwd→encoded-path logic and
    the JSONL record/`message.content` parsing, grouping records into `Answer`s.
- `render.rs` — `markdown(answers: &[Answer], opts: RenderOpts) -> String`.
  `RenderOpts { with_prompt, include_thinking, include_tools, tool_result_max }`.
  Renders `## User` / `## Assistant`, tool steps as fenced `tool: <name>`
  blocks, truncates tool results, replaces attachments/base64/file-snapshots
  with `[attachment: <label>]` placeholders.

Errors via the crate's existing error convention (match `transform.rs` /
`store`). Unit tests live next to the module with a small fixture JSONL
exercising every record/content shape and the answer-grouping boundary.

### `crates/cli/src/commands/session.rs` (new)

- clap `Args` (subcommand group `session` with `copy` for now), registered in
  `commands/mod.rs` and the top-level `Cli` enum following the `push` / `ai` /
  `transform` patterns.
- Flow: resolve source → resolve session → parse → resolve answer selection
  (picker via stdin / `--last` / `--all`) → `render::markdown` → then:
  - unless `--stdout`: save as a cinch clip (reuse the `push` storage path —
    `StoredClip`, `content_type = text`, `SyncState` pending so it syncs) with
    the derived/`-l` label;
  - unless `--no-copy`: copy the Markdown to the system clipboard via the
    existing `crate::io::copy_text_to_clipboard` helper;
  - `--stdout`: write Markdown to stdout (`crate::io::write_to_stdout`), skip
    clip+clipboard.
- Exit/error handling via `crate::exit`.

### Slash command — `.claude/commands/cinch-copy.md`

A thin Claude Code slash command that bridges Claude Code's built-in `/copy`
into cinch (see "Leveraging Claude Code `/copy`" below). The user runs `/copy`
(last answer → system clipboard), then `/cinch-copy [label]`, which ingests the
clipboard into a synced + searchable clip via `pbpaste | cinch push`. The full
`cinch session copy` command remains the path for cross-session selection /
older answers / whole sessions.

## Value over plain copy (why this lands in cinch)

Saving as a clip + clipboard simultaneously is the whole point:
1. **Paste anywhere now** — clipboard has clean Markdown for another AI/agent.
2. **Cross-device** — the clip syncs to other machines automatically.
3. **Searchable archive** — FTS over clip history for later reference.

## Phases

- **Phase 1 (now, macOS):** everything above = local full-clean render. No AI.
- **Phase 2 (later):** `--format handoff` → distilled "resume packet" via the
  existing `cinch ai` surface (goal / decisions / current state / files touched
  / next steps). Built only after Phase 1 is validated.

## Testing

- **Unit:** `client_core::session` parser + renderer against a fixture JSONL
  (covers text, tool_use, tool_result, thinking, attachment, multi-record
  answers, answer boundaries, title extraction, cwd→encoded-path).
- **CLI:** selection logic (`--last N`, `--all`, non-TTY error path), label
  derivation, `--stdout` vs clip+clipboard branching.
- **Manual (macOS):** in this repo, `cinch session copy --last 1` → confirm a
  clip is created (`cinch list`/desktop), clipboard holds clean Markdown, and it
  syncs to another device. Interactive picker selects a mid-session answer.
- Gates: `cargo build --workspace`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt`.

## Iteration 2 (2026-06-02): skim picker + MCP tools

Supersedes the numbered-list picker MVP and adds an AI-facing interface.

### Picker — embedded `skim` (fzf in Rust) with right-side preview

The numbered list + stdin picker made sessions/answers hard to recognize.
Replace it with the [`skim`](https://crates.io/crates/skim) crate (a Rust fzf
implementation) embedded in the CLI — **no external `fzf` binary**, and the
preview is computed **in-process** (no shell callback / hidden subcommand /
`current_exe`).

- Add `skim` to `crates/cli/Cargo.toml`. The skim API is version-sensitive
  (`SkimItem`, `SkimOptions`/builder, `Skim::run_with`, selected-items
  extraction, multi-select) — the implementer pins the resolved version and
  adapts to its actual API (read the resolved crate source under
  `~/.cargo/registry`; do not guess).
- Define `SkimItem` impls:
  - **Answer item:** `text()` = `[#i] <prompt preview>`; `preview()` = the
    rendered Markdown of *that one answer* via `client_core::session::render`
    (exactly what would be copied, current flags applied). Multi-select on
    (TAB) so several answers can be picked.
  - **Session item** (`--pick`): `text()` = `<mtime> · <title> · N answers`;
    `preview()` = a session overview — header (title · id · last activity · N
    answers) + a numbered table of contents of each answer's prompt preview, so
    the session is identifiable at a glance.
- `SkimOptions`: enable the preview pane (right side, e.g. `right:60%`, wrap),
  driven by the item `preview()` methods.
- Non-TTY behavior is unchanged: when stdin is not a TTY and neither
  `--last`/`--all` (nor `--pick` target) is given, error pointing at `--last`.
  No numbered-picker fallback is needed (skim is always available; the only
  failure mode is non-TTY, already guarded). The old numbered picker is removed.

### AI interface — MCP tools in `cinch mcp`

The existing hand-rolled JSON-RPC MCP server (`commands/mcp/protocol.rs`:
`tools_list()` + `handle_tool_call()`, currently 3 read tools, `since_ms`
exposure scope) gains 3 tools so an AI agent can browse and copy session
answers directly. All reuse `client_core::session` (no logic duplication) and
return the standard `content:[{type:text,text:<json>}]` envelope.

- **`list_agent_sessions`** — params: `project_dir?` (default: server cwd),
  `source?` (default `claude`). Returns sessions newest-first:
  `{id, title, last_activity_ms, answer_count}`.
- **`get_session_answers`** — params: `session?` (id prefix or `latest`),
  `project_dir?`, `source?`. Returns `[{index, prompt_preview, part_count}]` so
  the agent can choose.
- **`copy_session_answer`** — params: `session?`, `answers` (`last` | `all` |
  list of indices), `project_dir?`, `source?`, render flags (`with_prompt?`,
  `include_thinking?`, `no_tools?`), `save_clip?` (default **false**). Returns
  the rendered Markdown; saves a text clip (reusing the push path) only when
  `save_clip=true`.

> The MCP server's cwd is the agent's launch dir, which may differ from the
> user's project — hence the explicit `project_dir` parameter (default: server
> cwd) feeding `client_core::session`'s cwd→encoded-path resolution.

### Testing (iteration 2)

- Picker `SkimItem` `text()`/`preview()` are pure and unit-tested (the
  interactive TUI loop itself is not). Non-TTY guard test retained.
- MCP: extend `protocol.rs` tests — updated tool count, and per-tool
  `handle_tool_call` cases (list/get/copy, `save_clip` on/off, bad params).

## Iteration 3 (2026-06-02): leveraging Claude Code `/copy`

Claude Code ships a built-in `/copy` that copies the last answer to the system
clipboard (and writes a temp `copy.bash`). Question raised: can `cinch` reuse
it? Findings:

- `/copy` **cannot be a data source.** It is a TUI-internal command — not
  invokable from a shell/subprocess — and it only yields the *last* answer as
  raw text (clipboard), losing multi-answer selection, tool-step structure,
  cross-session access, and any persistence/sync/search. Wrapping it would be a
  downgrade. `cinch session copy` reads the source-of-truth JSONL directly,
  which is strictly more capable.
- Where `/copy` **does** help: for the in-session "save the answer I'm looking
  at right now" case, `/copy` reads in-memory state, so it is always perfectly
  fresh — it sidesteps the JSONL-flush lag that makes the latest turn render
  empty (the in-progress-turn bug, now also fixed in the renderer).

Decision: the `/cinch-copy` **slash command** consumes `/copy`'s output via the
system clipboard — a two-step flow (`/copy`, then `/cinch-copy`) implemented as
`pbpaste | cinch push` (synced + searchable clip; no new Rust). The rich
JSONL-based `cinch session copy` (picker / `--last N` / `--all` / MCP tools)
stays the path for cross-session selection and older answers. A custom slash
command cannot auto-trigger the built-in `/copy`, so the `/copy` step is manual
by necessity; this is acceptable and is documented in the command.

### In-progress-turn bug (fixed)

Empty answers (an in-progress trailing turn — a user prompt with no assistant
reply yet — or a thinking-only answer) previously rendered to a lone
`## Assistant` heading, so copy reported "saved" but produced a ~1-byte clip.
Fix: `render_answer()` returns `None` for content-less answers, `markdown()`
filter_maps them out, and a public `answer_is_empty()` predicate lets the CLI
picker and the MCP `copy_session_answer` tool filter to renderable answers (and
error clearly when none remain). Verified end-to-end: a real save now stores
~18 KB of markdown, never a 1-byte clip.

## Open / deferred

- Multi-answer concatenation ordering: render selected answers in session order.
- Phase 2 `--format handoff` (AI-distilled resume packet) remains deferred.
- Agent-neutral naming is locked in (`session` group, `--from`), even though
  only `claude` ships now.
